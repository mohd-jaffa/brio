## 2026-09-21 — Impeccable Shape: Design System & App Shell

### Changed (Design Token Compliance — Plan Section 42)
- Renamed `--color-bg` → `--color-background` to match plan token names (Lines 1669–1678).
- Fixed Peach Bakery `--color-surface` from cold white `#ffffff` to warm white `#fefaf6`.
- Added Tailwind v4 `@theme` bridge so components use `bg-background`, `text-primary`, etc. instead of `bg-[var(--color-background)]`.
- Added centralized `--radius-*`, `--shadow-card`, `--shadow-elevated`, `--color-primary-light` tokens.
- Replaced blanket `button, a { min-height: 44px }` with `.touch-target` utility (blanket rule broke inline links).
- Upgraded focus ring to two-tone outline (visible on primary-colored backgrounds).
- Added `.safe-top` / `.safe-bottom` CSS utilities for PWA/Capacitor safe area insets.

### Changed (Layout & Viewport — Plan Section 41)
- Removed `maximumScale: 1` and `userScalable: false` from viewport config (WCAG 1.4.4 fix).
- Removed broken `manifest: "/manifest.json"` reference (file does not exist).
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<html>` for theme hydration.

### Changed (ThemeProvider Hydration)
- Removed `visibility: hidden` wrapper div that caused Flash of Invisible Content (FOIC).
- Children render directly; server-side `data-theme="clean"` handles initial paint.
- Memoized `setTheme`/`toggleTheme` with `useCallback`.

### Changed (Navigation — Plan Section 9)
- Corrected mobile bottom nav from 5 items to plan-specified 4 items: Home, Orders, Customers, More.
- Expanded desktop sidebar from 5 items to plan-specified 9 items: Dashboard, Orders, Customers, Products, Inventory, Expenses, Analytics, Receipts, Settings.
- Added desktop header bar per plan Section 41 desktop wireframe (was hidden on desktop).
- Migrated nav items from `<button>` with local state to Next.js `<Link>` with real routing.
- Added `aria-label="Main navigation"`, `aria-current="page"`, `aria-hidden="true"` on emoji icons.
- Wrapped nav items in semantic `<ul>`/`<li>` structure.
- Added safe area inset padding for iOS/gesture-nav Android.
- Fixed mobile `<h1>` (was `<span>`, now proper `<h1>`).
- Added theme selector `role="radiogroup"` with `aria-checked` on desktop sidebar.

### Added (MoreSheet — Plan Section 9 Lines 333–342)
- Created `MoreSheet` bottom sheet component for mobile "More" tab.
- Lists: Products, Inventory, Expenses, Analytics, Receipts, Settings.
- Includes backdrop, escape-to-close, `aria-modal` dialog, slide-up animation.

### Changed (Dashboard — Plan Section 84 Priority Order)
- Restructured dashboard to match Section 84: Greeting → Summary Card → Pending Orders → Quick Actions → Low Stock → Monthly Snapshot → View Analytics.
- Orders grouped by due date: Overdue → Due Today → Tomorrow (Section 78–80).
- Summary card uses plan Section 77 metrics: Today's Orders, Revenue, Pending Orders, Pending Payments.
- Quick actions row per Section 82: + Add Order, + Add Customer, + Add Stock, + Add Expense.
- Monthly snapshot card per Section 83 with "View Analytics →" link.
- Removed developer metadata card ("Target Viewports", "Upload Policy", "Receipt Storage").
- Removed duplicate theme toggle from dashboard hero card.
- Replaced `<span cursor-pointer>` with proper interactive elements.
- Used `<dl>`/`<dt>`/`<dd>` for metrics, `<ul>`/`<li>` for order lists.
- Fixed heading hierarchy: `<h2>` section → `<h3>` card → `<h4>` group.
- Replaced all `text-[10px]` with `text-xs` minimum (12px).

### Validation
