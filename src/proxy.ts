/**
 * Keeps signed-out visitors out of the app's screens and signed-in bakers off
 * the sign-in screen (plan §19). It decides on the presence of the session
 * cookie alone — it never reads the token, because a proxy runs on every
 * request and is not where authorization belongs.
 *
 * One thing more: a screen asked for once the access token has run out (its
 * cookie expires with it) has the session renewed first (`renewSession`), so
 * the server can draw the screen signed in, with its data. That asks Supabase
 * at most once an hour.
 *
 * Nothing here is a security control. Whether a request may actually see a row
 * is settled by the route guard and by RLS (AGENTS.md §7); this only spares a
 * visitor a screen that would have nothing to show them.
