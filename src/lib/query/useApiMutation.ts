 * worked. Each sheet had its own try/catch/finally around exactly this.
 *
 * `revalidate` names the routes whose data this change makes stale
 * (src/lib/query/keys.ts); on success every read of them is refreshed —
 * searched, filtered and paged ones too (`useApiPages`), whose keys carry a
 * query or a mark that a route alone would miss. What happened is the
 * caller's to report, on the response card (plan §139.6): `onSuccess` gets the
 * result and `onError` the failure, which `respond.failure` turns into the
 * API's own words and its request id.
